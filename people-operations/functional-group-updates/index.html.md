## Format

Functional Group Updates are regular updates from a group at GitLab.

1. We'll use Zoom for now, will switch to YouTube Live later.
1. Presentations are optional, if you use them please ensure everyone with the url can access (inside and outside GitLab).
1. Use this [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/presentation/d/1JYHRhLaO9fMy1Sfr1WDnCPGv6DrlohlpOzs48VvmlQw/edit?usp=sharing) as template to your presentation.
1. Make sure to add the link of the presentation to the GitLab Availability Calendar invite at least 24 hours _before_ the call takes place. This allows team members to see the presentation, to click links, have [random access](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/838301787086008320) during the presentation,  and to quickly scan the presentation if they missed it. Please also add who the speaker will be to the presentation and the invite. To do this, go to the [GitLab availability calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=km839mvmkegodukmn933fp1ss4%40group.calendar.google.com), find the event, click on `more details` and edit the description. People Ops will ping the appropriate team member at the 24-hour mark if the event hasn't been updated yet.
1. Reduce distractions for yourself and the attendees by:
   - having the presentation open in its own new browser window, and only sharing that window in Zoom.
   - switching off notifications (from Slack, email, etc.). On Mac, in the notification center in the upper right hand corner, click on Notifications, select Do Not Disturb (sometimes you need to scroll up to see the option).  
1. All calls are published, with the exception of Finance, Sales, Security, Channel, and Partnerships. Every call is reviewed prior to publishing to make sure no internal information is shared externally.
1. Right now everyone at GitLab the company is invited to each call, we'll invite the wider community later.
1. Attendance is optional.
1. The update is also announced on and the recording linked from our team call agenda.
1. Tone should be informal, like explain to a friend what happened in the group last month, it shouldn't require a lot of presentation.
1. You can invite someone in the team to give the update, it doesn't need to be the team lead, but the team lead is responsible that it is given.
1. Calls are 4 times a week 30 minutes before the team call, 8:00 to 8:25am Pacific.
1. Calls do not go over time, if there are more questions invite them via chat, if there are no more questions feel free to end the call after 5 minutes.
1. Calls are scheduled by an [EA](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/executive-assistant/).
1. If you need to reschedule, please *switch* your presenting day with another FGU presenter. If you've agreed to switch do the following:
    - Go to the *GitLab Availabiltiy calendar* invite
    - Update the date of your and the other invite to be switched
    - Choose to send an update to the invitees
    - _If prompted_ with the questions to update 1 or all events, choose to only update this event
1. Every group with 5 people or more presents.
1. The call is recorded automatically, and all calls are transferred every hour to a Google Drive folder called "GitLab Videos", which is accessible to all users with a GitLab.com e-mail account.
1. Video recordings will be published on our blog so contributors, users, and customers can see it. We're aiming to publish a blog post once a week of that weeks' recordings with the matching slides in one go.

<!-- beginning of the intro - leave it as is -->

Every day from Monday to Thursday, right before our [GitLab Team call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call), a different Functional Group gives an [update](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/functional-group-updates/) to our team.

The format of these calls is simple and short where they can either give a presentation or quickly walk the team through their agenda.

<!-- more -->

## Recordings

All of the updates are recorded using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) at the time of the call. All the recordings will be uploaded to our YouTube account and made public, with the exception of the Sales and Finance updates.
