## Role of People Operations
{: #role-peopleops}

In general, the People Operations team and processes are here as a service to the rest of the team; helping make your life easier so that you can focus on your work and contributions to GitLab. On that note, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/handbook/people-operations/#reach-peopleops) with questions! In the case of a conflict between the company and a team member, People Operations works "on behalf of" the company.

## Team Directory
{: #directory}

GitLab uses Slack profiles as an internal team directory, where team members can add their personal contact details, such as email, phone numbers, or addresses. This is your one-stop directory for phone numbers and addresses (in case you want to send your team mate an awesome card!). Feel free to add your information to your Slack profile (this is completely opt-in!) by clicking on "GitLab" at the top left corner of Slack, "Profile & Account", then "Add Profile" (for the first time making changes) or "Edit Profile" (if your account is already set up) to make any changes!

- Please make sure that your address and phone information are written in such a way that your team mates can reach you from a different country. So, for example, include `+[country code]` in front of your phone number.

## Birthday Swag

BambooHR should send an email to People Ops the day before and the day of a team member's birthday. Celebrate by sending the team member an email (template below) and post on the #general channel on Slack so all team members can help them celebrate.

Birthday Email Template: "Happy Birthday! Please use this link [insert link] to redeem your birthday swag! You will need to login or create an account with the swag store to receive your free birthday socks! The username will be your GitLab email. Once you are are in the store you should see your options to order GitLab birthday socks. Please let People Ops know if you have any questions."

The link for the swag store birthday campaign is located in the People Ops vault in 1Password.

Monitor the swag store open orders to place orders that team members have entered for birthday swag.

## Letter of Employment and Reference Request Policy

If you need a letter from GitLab verifying your employment/contractor status, please send the request to People Ops citing what information is needed. We will provide most recent title, dates of employment, and salary information. We will also verify, but not provide National Identification Numbers. People Ops will send you the letter once it is completed. In addition, if the request comes from a third party, People Ops will always verify that the information is appropriate to share. If you are a US Employee you can follow these [instructions](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPYlZ4RWNpaFZHRU1UYjJJdmxXaUlFLTJ0OXhB/view?usp=sharing) for an automated verification through TriNet.

GitLabbers are not authorized by the company to speak on its behalf to complete reference requests for GitLabbers no longer working for GitLab. If a team member would like to give a personal reference based on their experience with the former team member, it must be preceded by a statement that the reference is not speaking on behalf of the company. To reinforce this fact, personal references should never be on company letterhead and telephone references should never be on company time. You do not need permission from GitLab to give a personal reference. Remember to always be truthful in reference check and try not to give a majority negative reference; instead refuse to provide one. Negative references can result in legal action in some jurisdictions.

If an ex team member acted in a malicious way against GitLab we'll do a company wide announcement on the team call not to provide a reference.

## Office addresses
{: #addresses}

- For the SF office, see our [visiting](https://about.gitlab.com/visiting/) page.
- For the NL office, we use a postbox address listed in the "GitLab BV address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password. We use [addpost](https://www.addpost.nl) to scan our mail and send it along to a physical address upon request. The scans are sent via email to the email alias listed in the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc.
- For the UK office, there is a Ltd registered address located in the "GitLab Ltd (UK) Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password
- For the Germany office, there is a GmbH address located in the "GitLab GmbH Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password

## Business Cards

If you need updated business cards, please send an email to `peopleops@gitlab.com`, and someone on the team will place the order. In the email please include the following information:

- Name, as you would like it displayed on the business cards
- email
- Phone number
- GitLab handle
- Twitter handle
- City, state (if applicable), and country (the city can be your metro area if different from your address)
- Shipping address

If you need them for an event, please also include the date by which you need them delivered and if you need more than the standard pack of 50 cards.

## Regular compensation

1. Employees of our Dutch entity (GitLab B.V.) will get their salary wired on the
25th of every month, and can see their pay slip in their personal portal on
[HR Savvy's system](https://hr-savvy.nmbrs.nl/) towards the end of the month.
1. Employees of our Dutch entity who are based in Belgium will get their salary wired  around the last day of each month and will receive their pay slip in their personal portal on [Boekfisk's system](http://www.boekfisk.be/)
1. Employees of our Dutch entity based in India that are employed through GitLab's co-employer [Lyra](http://lyrainfo.com/) will get their salary wired around the last day of the month. Lyra will send pay slips electronically but will be switching to a HR portal very soon so that pay slips and tax declaration forms can be accessed directly.
1. Employees of our US entity (GitLab Inc.) have payroll processed [semi-monthly](https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/biweekly-semimonthly-payroll)
through TriNet, and they can access their pay slips through the [TriNet portal](https://www.hrpassport.com).
1. Employees of our UK entity (GitLab Ltd) will get their salary wired on the last day of every month, and can see their pay slip via their personal portal on [Vistra's system](https://www.vistra.com/) towards the end of the month.
1. Contractors to GitLab should send their invoices for services rendered to `ap@gitlab.com`.
   - The first invoice should be prorated. You can do this by taking the total working days from your start date divided by total work days in the month multiplied by your monthly rate.
   - For 'fixed fee' contracts, it is OK to send the invoice before the time period
   that it covers is over. For example, an invoice covering the period of March 1-31 can be sent on March 25.
   - All invoices are internally reviewed, approved, and then payment is processed.
   This is usually a fast process, but be aware that it can incur delays around vacations. In principal, payments go out once per week on Fridays.
   - An invoice template can be found as a Google sheet named "Invoice Template" (also listed on the [finance page](/handbook/finance/) )
1. To process any changes, see the directions on the [system processes page](/handbook/people-operations/system-processes/#processing-changes).

## NPS Surveys

NPS stands for "Net Promoter Score". GitLab has two forms of NPS surveys: eNPS for all employees (where "e" stands for "Employee"), and an onboarding NPS. These surveys gauge employee satisfaction and how likely employees are to recommend GitLab to others as a place to work.

People Ops will send out an eNPS survey twice yearly to all employees.

The onboarding NPS survey is a 60-day survey for new hires. To help People Ops understand your experience and improve the onboarding process, please complete the [onboarding survey](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU8qxThxRu3tdrExFGBJ1GlyucCoJj2kDpcvOlM4AiRGOavQ/viewform) after you have been working for GitLab for at least 2 months. People Ops will send reminders to team members to complete the survey.

## Policies

### Background checks

We will obtain employment and criminal background checks for team members based on specific project, client, and/or department assignments. Team members in Support Engineer and Solutions Architect positions, People Ops, Finance, Sales (client-dependent), and the Executive team have been selected to go through this process. Other positions/departments may be added in the future based on business requirements.

We have contracted with [Checkr](https://checkr.com/) to perform these background checks, which will cover criminal history for the last 7 years and employment history for the last 5 years and/or the three most recent employers. GitLab may use the returned background check information to make decisions regarding employment; therefore, the employment of those in the affected positions is contingent upon a successful completion of the background check. Due to the remote nature of our company, offenses involving driving or motor vehicles are not considered actionable violations.

Incoming candidates will receive an email to fill out the background check application following an offer. The application process includes signing a disclosure and a consent form which explains the rights of an individual undergoing a background examination. The application process is designed to take less than fifteen minutes to complete.

All team members in the affected positions will be required to complete the background check process, regardless of location. Applicants outside of the US or non-citizens will be required to provide a passport number and national ID number as part of their criminal background check. At this time, Checkr does not support non-US employment verification, so People Ops will be reaching out to collect the appropriate information.

To prepare for the employment application process, please gather each previous employer's name and address, your position title held, employment start and end dates, manager’s name and title, their phone number, and email address. Details for a Human Resources contact can be entered instead of a manager's contact details. If you have been self-employed, you must provide backup documentation to act as proof of employment. This documentation can be in the form of tax returns (e.g. W2s), paystubs, LLC documentation, official company registrations, etc.

Applicants may be required to submit a form of picture ID to process their background check. For security purposes, documentation via email will not be accepted; applicants should check their email for the secure link that Checkr will automatically send in order to upload their document.

Background checks will act as an additional mechanism of transparency and will help to build trust with our clients. We will continue to develop this draft policy to ensure we apply a fair and consistent process which is as respectful to the privacy of our team members as possible while remaining compliant.

#### Credit Checks
Finance team members **only** will be required to participate in a credit check, due to the nature of their work with company finances. The credit checks will be performed through Checkr.

#### Initiating a Background Check

***US Candidates Only***

1. Log in to the Checkr platform and select *Candidates*.
2. Click on *Invite Candidates* and select *Employee Pro Last 3* from the dropdown list.
3. Enter the candidates personal email address and click *Send Invitations*.

***International Candidates***

1. Repeat the first step from the list above but select *International Criminal Search*.
2. A member of the People Operations team will need to reach out to the candidate to gather previous employer details for employment verification from the candidate directly.

### Sick time - taking and reporting
{: #sick-time}

In keeping with our [values](/handbook/values) of freedom, efficiency, transparency, kindness, and boring solutions, we have crafted the following protocol around sick leave for all GitLabbers.

**All GitLabbers**

- If you or a loved one is ill, we want you to take care of yourself or your loved one(s). To facilitate this, you should take sick leave when you need it. Sick leave is meant to be used when you are ill, or to care for family members including your parent(s), child(ren), spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent(s), grandchild(ren), and sibling(s).
- You do need to report when you take sick leave, either by emailing your manager and People Ops, or by using the "Request time off" function in BambooHR. This way, it can be tracked in BambooHR and related payroll systems.
- If you need sick leave for more than 8 consecutive calendar days, notify your manager and People Ops to accommodate an extended leave request. What can (or must) be accommodated varies from location to location: GitLab will comply with the applicable laws in your specific location.
- Upon request, you should be able to provide proper documentation of the reason for your sick leave (doctor's note).

**Details for specific groups of GitLabbers**

- Employees of GitLab Inc. who receive a pay stub from TriNet will see sick time accrue on their pay stub at the rate of 0.0346 hrs per hour worked (3 hours of sick leave per semi-monthly pay-period) for a maximum accrual and carry-over of 72 hours per year. GitLab's policy is more generous than this, in the sense that you can take off non-accrued sick time as written above (a negative balance may show on your pay stub). Sick time does not get paid out in case of termination, nor does it reduce your final paycheck in case of a negative balance. Related to the topic of extended leave requests, see information about [short term disability](/handbook/benefits/#std-ltd) through TriNet / your state.
- Employees of GitLab B.V. have further rights and responsibilities regarding sick time based on Dutch law, as written into their employment [contracts](/handbook/contracts/#employee-contractor-agreements).
- GitLab has engaged with an occupational health and safety centre, Zorg van de Zaak, to assist employees of GitLab B.V. who may need support whilst being on long-term sick leave.
- If an employee is sick People Operations will inform HRSavvy and they will be registered in their HR portal from the first day of sickness.
- If the employee is then on long-term sick leave (1 working week or more) depending on the situation and agreement with the employee, People Operations will instruct HRSavvy to register the employee at the occupational health and safety service.
- Zorg van de Zaak's contact details can be found in the People Operations 1Password vault.

### Military Leave
{:#military-leave}

GitLab is committed to protecting the position rights of team members absent on military leave. No team member or prospective team member will be subjected to any form of discrimination on the basis of membership in or obligation to perform service for any of the Uniformed Services of their country of residency. If any team member believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination in violation of this policy, immediately contact People Operations for assistance. For any questions about how to initiate a military leave, please contact People Operations.

### Hiring Significant Other or Family Members

GitLab is committed to a policy of employment and advancement based on **qualifications and merit** and does not discriminate in favor of or in opposition to the employment of significant others or relatives. Due to the potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, which can be carried into the daily working relationship, GitLab will hire or consider other employment actions concerning significant others and/or relatives of persons currently employed or contracted only if:
a) candidates for employment will not be working directly for or supervising a significant other or relative, and
b) candidates for employment will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which employees can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to the significant other or relative. Such decisions include hiring, retention, transfer, promotion, wages, and leave requests.

This policy applies to all current employees and candidates for employment.

### Gift Policy

People Operations will send flowers for a birth, death, or significant event of a team member. This policy applies to an immediate relationship to the GitLab team member. Management can send a request to People Operations in order to ensure that a gift is sent in the amount of 75-125 USD.

### Relocation

If your permanent address is changing, notify People Operations of the new address within the pay cycle of the move.  The best way to do this is by logging in to BambooHR and changing your address under the **Personal** tab. This triggers a message to the BambooHR admin to review the change and "accept" it.

If you are going to spend six months or more in one location this will be considered as a relocation and your compensation will be evaluated based on the new metro region.

- If your relocation is to a different metro area, then to stay aligned with our [compensation principles](/handbook/people-operations/global-compensation-calculator/#compensation-principles) and per the [standard contract agreements](/handbook/contracts), you should obtain written agreement first (from your manager). It is the company's discretion to offer you a contract in your new location. In almost all situations the compensation will change, for an idea about the impact please see our [move calculator](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/move). The move calculator may not always yeild accurate results. Please run your move past our People Operations Analyst for more accurate figures, and to ensure you are using the correct [geographical areas](/handbook/people-operations/global-compensation/#geographical-areas).
- The People Ops Analyst will review the new location's impact on compensation. If the team member is moving to a lower cost of living, the change only needs to be approved by their manager and the Chief Culture Officer. If the team member is moving to a higher cost of living, the People Ops Analyst will escalate to the Chief Culture Officer and the CEO for approval.
- People Ops will check that any necessary changes to payroll and benefits administration are processed in time.
- People Ops will process any changes that are agreed on, and file the email in BambooHR.
- If there are any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Chief Culture Officer.

### Tuition Reimbursement

GitLab supports team members who wish to continue their education and growth within their professional career. If you are a full-time GitLabber and have been employed for more than three months, you are eligible to participate in this program.
To be eligible for reimbursement, courses must be a requirement of a degree or certification program and delivered through a credentialed college or university.

GitLabbers are eligible for a maximum calendar year (January 1st - December 31st) reimbursement equivalent to 4,000 USD. Courses eligible for reimbursment include for credit classes resulting in a grade (not pass/fail), courses providing continuing
education credits, and/or courses taken as part of a certification program. You must earn a passing grade equivalent to a “B” or obtain a successful completion certification to submit for reimbursement. The progam will cover only the tuition and enrollment related fees.
Additional fees related to parking, books, supplies, technology, or administrative charges are not covered as part of the program. Tuition will be validated by receipt of payment. A description of the course(s) and degree or certification program along with a
final grade report or satistfactory certificate of completion are required to receive reimbursement.

#### Tuition Reimbursement Process

To receive tuition reimbursement, GitLabbers should follow the following process:

1. GitLabber first discusses their interest in professional development with their manager.
1. If the manager agrees that the degree or certification program is aligned with the business and growth opportunities within GitLab, a minimum of three weeks prior to the course start date, the GitLabber fills out a [Tuition Reimbursement Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WvPzoUMpcaUUOm3Gl5eDKQDw_-TtI4J0LP5ifMa8Vo/edit) and forwards it to People Ops to stage for the proper signatures (GitLabber, Manager, People Operations) in HelloSign.
1. The People Ops Analyst will confirm there are no additional [tax implications](/handbook/people-operations/#tax-implications-for-tuition-reimbursement-by-country) for reimbursement in the team member's country.
1. People Ops will file the application and signed agreement in BambooHR.
1. Once the course is completed, an official grade report or successful certification of completion must be submitted to People Operations.
1. After grades are verified, People Operations will ensure the reimbursement is processed through the applicable payroll by the second pay cycle after submission.

#### Tax Implications for Tuition Reimbursement by Country

In some countries, tuition reimbursement may be considered as taxable income.  Please reach out to your tax professional for clarification.

## Mental Health Awareness

1. What is Mental Health?

* The World Health Organisation (WHO) [defines health](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj3oZ7I1M_XAhUsI8AKHXWiC5EQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fgovernance%2Feb%2Fwho_constitution_en.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0usN4G0kSEScrW3HqENGIr) as:
     * *"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.  The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition."*

* The WHO [defines mental health](http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/) as:
     * *“a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.”*

* Taking these in turn
     * *"A state of well-being"* is a self-reported measure of 'wellness';
     * *"The individual realizes his or her own abilities"* requires feedback, positive or negative;
     * *"Can cope with the normal stresses of life"* i.e. does not find normal life overwhelming too much of the time;
     * *"Can work productively and fruitfully"* here GitLab clearly has a role to play as it can provide an opportunity for productive and fruitful work;
     * *"Is able to make a contribution to his or her community"* versus the inverse, which is only being able to draw from that community.

1. Why is awareness of Mental Health important at GitLab?
  * It can affect any and all of us.  The statistics from the WHO are that [1 in 4](http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/) of us will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in our life.  That said, we are all subject to periods where we or those around us find the "the normal stresses of life" harder than usual to deal with.
  * The more aware we are of mental health, the more inclusive we are.  That will help encourage any colleagues currently experiencing mental health issues to talk about it.
  * Our business at its core is a group of people working together towards a common goal.  With awareness of what might affect our colleagues, we are better equipped to help them if they do discuss it with us and therefore help our business.
  * Mental health has so much emotional baggage as a topic that it can initially seem scary to talk about.  Promoting mental health awareness helps to remove the stigma and taboo associated with it.
  * GitLab can offer "productive and fruitful" work for all of our employees.  That should not be [underestimated](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwitr7eP18_XAhWIORoKHY2_CA4QFggrMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcardinal-management.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2FBurton-Waddell-is-work-good-for-you.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0ROXJdWquGML5bIsBEIRLo).
  * In the cold-light of business metrics, the healthier we are, [the more productive we are](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/workplace-health-wellbeing-productivity.html).

1. At GitLab we strive to create a Stigma-Free Workplace. In accordance with the National Mental Health Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health we would like to:
  * Educate employees about the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders.
  * Encourage employees to talk about stress, workload, family commitments, and other issues.
  * Communicate that mental illnesses are real, common, and treatable.
  * Discourage stigmatizing language, including hurtful labels such as “crazy,” “loony” or “nuts.”
  * Help employees transition back to work after they take leave.
  * Consult with your employee assistance program.

1. What are we doing to get there?
  * Per an open [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/138), People Operations will be developing training for managers on this topic.
  * GitLab would also like to encourage GitLabbers to take their [time off](/handbook/paid-time-off) to properly take care of themselves. We encourage the team to go to yoga, take a long lunch, or anything else in their day to day life that assists in their mental and emotional well-being.
  * In addition to our current EAP programs available for employees, we encourage GitLabbers to take a look at [Working Through It](http://www.workplacestrategiesformentalhealth.com/wti/Home.aspx) for insight into reclaiming well-being at work, off work, and return to work.
  * We believe that our values and culture lends itself to being able to discuss mental health open and honestly without being stigmatized, but let's work together to make it even more inclusive.
    * For example, Finding the right words:
      * "How can we help you do your job?"
      * "You’re not your usual self."
      * "Do you want to talk about it?"
      * "It's always OK to ask for help."
      * "It’s hard for me to understand exactly what you’re going through, but I can see that it’s distressing for you."

Any questions or concerns? Please feel free to speak with anyone in People Ops!

## WBSO (R&D tax credit) in the Netherlands

For roles directly relating to Research and Development in the Netherlands, GitLab may be eligible for the [WBSO (R&D Tax Credit)](http://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso). For more information, contact the WBSO People Ops rep.

## Paperwork people may need to obtain mortgage in the Netherlands
{: #dutch-mortgage}

When your employment contract is for a fixed period of time (e.g. 12 months) you'll need a "werkgeversverklaring".
This document describes your salary and states that your employer expects to continue to employ
you after the contract expires (assuming the performance of the employee doesn't degrade).
This document has to be filled in by hand, preferably using blue ink, and must be signed
and stamped. If there is no stamp (as is the case for GitLab) an extra letter (also signed)
must be supplied that states the employer has no stamp. While the language of these
documents doesn't matter, the use of Dutch is preferred.

Employees also have to provide a copy of a payslip that clearly states not only their
monthly salary but also their annual salary. These numbers must match the numbers on
the "werkgeversverklaring" down to the decimals. Mortgage providers may also require
you to provide information about your financial status, usually in the form of a report/screenshot
of your total financial status (including any savings you have). The requirements for
this seem to vary a bit between mortgage providers.
