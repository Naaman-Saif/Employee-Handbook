### India


- Healthcare in India is opt-in. So, you’d have to tell us if you want to be covered.
- Policy will be for 1 year and will be renewed automatically as long as you’re with us.
- You can buy from health insurance companies directly, the only advantage you have with us that its cheaper (10-15%) because we buy insurance for the company together and not individually and its automatically accounted on your paycheck.

### Other Countries

- Unfortunately, we don't support health insurance in other countries yet. Please talk to local insurance company to get you and your family covered. We **highly recommend** you do.
