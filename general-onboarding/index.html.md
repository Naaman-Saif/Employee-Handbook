## Onboarding How To

### Welcome to GitLab

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and starting your first day at GitLab. We are so excited that you are here! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the handbook, to completing the onboarding issue. Regardless of your role, we all use GitLab, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you! At times the onboarding issue might feel overwhelming, but if you have any additional questions along the way, please feel free to ask [People Ops](/handbook/people-operations/), your buddy, or anyone else at GitLab in the `#questions` channel on Slack.

### Your First Day

Throughout your first few weeks at GitLab it is important to focus on the onboarding issue. The onboarding issue is specific to you, for an idea what is in there please see the [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md). This guide will help you understand what is in the onboarding issue, and why we are asking you to complete the items on the issue.

#### Getting Started

* Prepare for your first [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#team-call). In the calendar invite is a link to the Team Call agenda. The first time that you join, please make sure that you connect at least 10 minutes before the call in order to download Zoom and make sure that your camera and
microphone are working properly. We'd like you to introduce yourself to the team (±1 minute), so please prepare three talking points for yourself. Please make sure to tell us about where you were before GitLab, why you wanted to join our team, and what you like to do in your spare time.

* Connect with GitLab's social media sites:
  1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com)
  1. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab)
  1. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab)
  1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg)

#### Working Remotely

1. The first month at a remote company can be hard. Take a look at [3 Things I Learned in My First Month at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/11/02/three-things-i-learned-in-my-first-month-at-gitlab/) for some insight from a GitLabber.

### The Onboarding Issue

In the onboarding issue, we ask you to complete a variety of tasks. Here are some [tips](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips) on items like gmail, zoom, calendly, etc. The onboarding issue can be seen at the bottom of this page.

#### 1Password

We recommend that you set up your 1Password account early in the onboarding process since you will need it to hold all of the new passwords that you will create. This is an awesome tool, that GitLab uses to store all passwords for each department. You will also have your personal vault where you can store all the passwords that you are creating for GitLab. In keeping with our [security best practices](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/). We ask that you do set up this 1Password account with your GitLab email, even though you might have one already.

#### 2FA

GitLab asks you to enable 2FA (2-Step Verification, also known as two-factor authentication), because it adds an extra layer of security to your account. You sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone). If you have problem with 2FA just let people ops know! We can disable it for you to then set it up again. If the problem persists, then we can direct you to one of our super admins.

#### BambooHR and TriNet

BambooHR is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. We have self-service enabled so that at any time you can access your account to see your employment information and documentation. As part of onboarding, please make sure to update everything that is applicable to you on the Personal tab, your ethnicity (which is located on the Jobs tab), and emergency contact information. We also ask that you provide People Ops with a Photo ID which is used for Employment Verification Purposes. You can send this documentation in any way you feel most comfortable. Some common ways in the past have been emailing People Ops, sending as a direct message to our People Ops Analyst in Slack, or scheduling a call with our People Ops Analyst to view the documentation.

The information from BambooHR is used to feed other systems, so it is important that it is filled out before you start. If you are a GitLab Inc. employee, you will receive login information from TriNet, our payroll and benefits provider, within 24 hours of your start date.

##### GitLab.com vs Dev.GitLab.org

The dev server is only viewable to team members, and is used by the Development team (amongst others). Per the [GitLab workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#gitlab-workflow) point 9, everything that can be public should be out in the open. GitLab.com is viewable to anyone with an account. We ask you to set up your GitLab.com account with your GitLab email for additional security.

##### Calendly

Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others at the company. (Great for also setting up coffee breaks!) All team members add Calendly to their Slack profile as a part of onboarding, so if you ever need or want to speak with another team member, you can schedule the meeting yourself. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific GitLab account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it per [spending company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money).

##### Egencia

You will receive an email to set up your account for Egencia. This travel is for company purposes, and is paid for by the company at the time of booking. For more information on setting up your account please visit our [travel page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-and-lodging-with-egencia).

#### Add yourself to the team page

We are happy to have you join our company and to include
you in our [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/). The following are
the steps to add yourself to the team page. Please follow the links that will guide you to full guides about every step. If you are not familiar with local git yet, feel free to do this through the web interface, and ask anyone at the company questions along the way.

##### Add on GitLab.com

### Reading the Handbook

A core value of GitLab is documentation. Therefore, everything that we do, we have documented on about.gitlab.com. This can make the handbook seem huge! Don't let it scare you. To simplify navigating the handbook here are some suggested steps. Feel free to take a wrong turn at any time to learn more about whatever you are interested in.

1. Read [about](https://about.gitlab.com/about/) the company, and [How we use GitLab to build GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/07/07/how-we-use-gitlab-to-build-gitlab/). It is important to understand our [culture](/culture), and how the organization was started. If you have any questions about company products you can always check out our [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#compare) and [products](https://about.gitlab.com/products/).
1. Tackle general section of the [handbook](/handbook/). Here are some highlights that are important for new hires to pay attention to:
  * Make sure to read over our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values) and [general guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines) to answer any questions you might have about what to do and when.
  * If you have questions about what is in the handbook check out the [handbook usage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage) as well as your own department's sub-page of the handbook (which can be found at the top of the handbook).
  * [Communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication) is extremely important within a remote only organization. Read through the guidelines to understand how we make [working remotely](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/working-remotely) successful.
  * Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines/#intellectual-property).
1. Since we are a global organization understand your benefits might be different than other team members at the company based on which [contract](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) you signed. It is important to understand **your** [benefits](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/benefits/). If you have questions please reach out to People Ops.
  * Notable Benefits that apply to all team members:
    1. [No ask time off policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off): GitLab truly does value a work-life balance, and encourages team members to have a flexible schedule and take vacations. If you feel uncomfortable about taking time off, or are not sure how much time to take off throughout the year, feel free to speak with your manager or People Operations. We will be happy to reinforce this policy! Please note the additional steps that might need to be taken if you are scheduled for [on call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/on-call).
    1. Check out [People Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/) to learn more about our [policies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#policies).
    1. As part of onboarding, you received an email asking if you needed any equipment. Throughout your time at GitLab you might need additional equipment, would like to learn how to code, or want to visit a team member! Make sure you know what you can [spend company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money) on.
    1. The handbook also describes [incentives](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives) such as sales, dinners, or bonuses, that can apply to all GitLab team members. Know any great talent to refer?
1. Even if you come from a technical background, it is important to understand the [proper workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#gitlab-workflow) since this is how we are all able to operate remotely in a successful way. If you come from a non-technical background, and would like more clarification on what this workflow means, feel free to ask People Ops, your manager, or anyone else at the company.

#### Learning Git and GitLab

If you need any help with Git itself, subscribe to the [`#git-help`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/git-help) channel on Slack and feel free to ask any question you might have.

##### Becoming Familiar with Projects on GitLab.com

* You should have been provided access to our [Internal GitLab Server](https://dev.gitlab.org). Once you feel comfortable with GitLab, take a moment to familiarize yourself with:
  1. The Dashboard
  1. The Projects
  1. The Issue Tracker
* Become familiar with the README.md’s for these projects:
  1. [GitLab Enterprise Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/)
  1. [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/)
  1. [GitLab www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com)
* As part of onboarding you created an account on our external / public [GitLab Server](https://gitlab.com). Have your manager grant access to the GitLab Enterprise Edition Project, Standard Subscribers Group and other projects / groups relevant to your role.
* Learn how to use our Internal Issue Trackers:
We use GitLab Issues to raise awareness, discuss, and propose solutions for various issues related to any aspect of our business.
The most common Issues are created in the following projects:
  1. [GitLab Enterprise Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues) - Issues related to GitLab Enterprise Edition
  1. [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues) - customer requests
  1. [GitLab www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) - Issues related to our website
* Add issues in the correct Issue Tracker:
  1. Public issues related to GitLab website: use [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com)
  1. Internal issues related to documentation and gitlab.com usage: Use [GitLab HQ](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq)
  1. Issues related to the organization: Use [GitLab Organization](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/organization) consider making them confidential
  1. Internal issues relate to Enterprise Edition: Use [GitLab EE](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ee)

##### Learn how to use Git Locally

Learn how to [get started with git](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/git-page-update). It is important for all team members to understand how to work on the Web UI and locally. The rest of the team is happy to assist in teaching you git.

#### Merge Requests and Permissions

When you are first starting at GitLab and creating new merge requests, you can assign the MRs to your manager. Going forward, it's best practice to assign the MR to the relevant department; for example, if you are making an edit to the People Ops section of the handbook, please assign it to someone within People Ops.

If you're unsure of who to assign a merge request to or if you have any questions or problems, feel free to reach out to your manager or onboarding buddy. You can also ask in the [`#git-help`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/git-help) channel in Slack!

When you join GitLab your GitLab.com account will be added to the [gitlab-com group](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/group_members) as a Developer. Please see this [blog post discussing how we assign permissions](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/11/26/keeping-your-code-protected/), as well as a [permission levels chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) to find out more about what each level can do.

### Questions?

At any time if you have questions, please ask your manager, buddy, [People Ops](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/), or anyone else at the company!


Please [add to me](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/edit/master/source/handbook/general-onboarding/index.html.md). Questions that were not answered? Something that is not clear? Please create an issue or a merge request and assign it to People Ops to make this documentation better for the next new team member.

## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires

[Create a new **confidential** issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/new) for new hire in organization using the `onboarding` template [from the dropdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/description_templates.html#using-the-templates).
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task.
Please [update the list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/edit/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md) as more steps arise, and then also update the associated item on the [offboarding list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding.md).

## Quiz

Employees should answer GitLab quiz questions in the first 2 weeks of working in the company. If the answers are not accurate, you may retest once: [GitLab Quiz](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/questions/)
Please schedule a call with your manager.

#### 60-day Onboarding Survey

Please see [the NPS section](/handbook/people-operations/#nps-surveys) of our handbook.
