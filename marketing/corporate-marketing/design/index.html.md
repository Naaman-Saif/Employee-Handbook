## Requesting design help

1. Create an issue in the corresponding project repository
    1. For tasks pertaining to [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) create an issue in the [www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues).
    1. For all other marketing related tasks create an issue in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues).
1. Add all relevant details, goal(s), purpose, resources, and links in the issue description. Also `@` mention team members who will be involved.
1. Set due date (if possible) â€” small last-minute requests are OK, we understand, but in order to do our best work let's not make a habit of it.
1. Add the `Design` and `Website Redesign` (if applicable) label(s) to your issue.

## The `Design` label in issue tracker

The `Design` label helps us find and track issues relevant to the Design team. If you create an issue where Design is the primary focus, please use this label.

## Project prioritization

Per the Design team's discretion, the prioritization of design projects will be based on the direct impact on Marketing.

To get a better sense of [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues) prioritization, you can view the [Design Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/boards/273272). More specifically the `Design - Working On` and `Design - Top Priority` lists.

Design projects within the [www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) can be tracked using the [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Design) label. The prioritization of projects for [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) can be viewed on the [Website Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/boards/349137).

Any design requests that do not fall in line with the goals and objectives of Marketing will be given a lower priority and factored in as time allows.
