When creating an event (live or online), webcast, or gated content its important to integrate the campaign across the three main platforms used - Unbounce (landing page), Marketo (Marketing Automation) and Salesforce (CRM). This provides transparency about the event to anyone with access to Salesforce, namely the Sales and Marketing teams.
