## Objectives

Generate MQLs by:

1. Showcasing the benefits of the most important GitLab features and how they
   can save time and money.
2. Compare GitLab vs competing products.
3. Provide customer case studies which illustrate 1 and 2.

## Scope

When referring to the GitLab website, the documentation `docs.gitlab.com` and
the `about.gitlab.com/handbook` are not included.

## Ownership and responsibilities

### Website Product Manager

[Luke Babb](https://about.gitlab.com/team/#lukebabb) (interim) is responsible for
scheduling tasks and allocating various team members to accomplish tasks.

Track projects on the [Website Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/boards/349137).

### Product Marketing

- Value proposition pages like homepage, features, EE standalone, and EE premium
  features.
- Top of funnel webpages that are focused on lead generation to get people
  interested and excited about GitLab's products (e.g. solution landing pages
  like GitLab for DevOps or Why Git and GitLab over legacy tools).
- SEO entry webpages.
- Sales enablement pages (e.g. products page, comparison pages, case
  study pages).
- Along with the Website Product Manager, create design briefs for the Design
  team to turn into mockups and designs. Work with the Design team to improve
  and implement the design brief over a number of iterations.

### Design team

- Create design mockups for design briefs given by the Product Marketing team.
- Iterate on the design mockups until goals and objectives of the page are met, and the Product Marketing team approve.
- Produce a final [Sketch spec preview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/tree/master#repository-superpowers-) and artwork assets for the Frontend Development team to implement.
- Review front-end implementation (merge request) and provide feedback and guidance to improve the design.

### Frontend Development team

- Implement final approved design mockup.
- Pixel-push the design based on feedback from the Design team to match the final design mockup and vision for the page.

### All Product Managers

- Updating the *technical feature comparison tables* on
  `about.gitlab.com/comparison` and `about.gitlab.com/products` for the products
  they manage e.g GitLab column and competitor columns with list of feature
  names.

### The Technical Writing team

- Technical content on the `about.gitlab.com/installation` page (not the design
  and UX of this page which shoud be shared with the marketing site).
- Assist the Product Managers with the backlog of missing *technical feature
  comparison tables* on `about.gitlab.com/comparison` and
  `about.gitlab.com/products` e.g GitLab CI vs Jenkins.
  The Technical Writing team own the tasks from the backlog but will still have
  to ask the relevant Product Manger for content input as they know the
  feature's competitive landscape better than anyone.
- With regards to documentation the Technical Writing team is focusing on
  up to date and feature complete written documentation. No video content is
  planned for now.
