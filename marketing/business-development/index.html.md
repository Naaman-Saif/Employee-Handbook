# Welcome<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to GitLab and congratulations on landing a job with the best open source tech company! We are excited to have you join the team and look forward to working closely with you and seeing you grow and develop into a top performing salesperson.

As a BDR (Business Development Representative) your focus will be on qualifying inbound leads. On this team we work hard, but have fun too. We will work hard to guarantee your success if you do the same. We value results, transparency, sharing, freedom, efficiency, frugality, collaboration, directness, kindness, diversity, solutions, and quirkiness.

Being a BDR can come with what seems like long days, hard work, frustration, and even at times, failure. If you have the right mindset and come to work with a tenacious, hungry attitude you will see growth personally and in your career. GitLab is a place with endless opportunity. Let’s make it happen! 	

### Your Role<a name="role"></a>
As a BDR, you will be dealing with the front end of the sales process. You play a crucial role that helps bridge the gap between sales and marketing. You will be tasked with generating qualified opportunities for GitLab as you look for leads, research companies, industries, and different roles.

As you gain knowledge, you will be able to aid these key players in solving problems within the developer lifecycle. There are numerous resources at your fingertips that we have created to help you in this process. You have:

1. [BDR Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/business-development/) - This will help you with your day to day workflow. You can find information on how to prospect, best practices, customer FAQs, buyer types, cadence samples and more. Use the BDR handbook in conjunction with the [Marketing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/) and [Sales](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/) handbooks. This will help you bridge the gap between the two and learn the product and process faster.
1. [GLU GitLab University](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/university/) - These trainings will teach the fundamentals of Version Control with Git and GitLab through courses that cover topics which can be mastered in about 2 hours. These trainings include an intro to Git, GitLab basics, a demo of Gitlab.com, terminology, and more. You can also find information about GitLab compared to other tools in the market.
2. Gmail
3. Salesforce
4. [Outreach](https://outreach.io/)
4. LinkedIn
5. [Lattice](https://latticehq.com/) - A tool that tracks our OKRs (Objective and Key Results)
6. [Grovo](https://www.grovo.com/) - A learning management system with short, engaging tracks focused on specific skills.
7. Slack
8. Google Drive

### Onboarding<a name="onboard"></a>
You will be assigned an onboarding issue by Peopleops. Tasks in the issue will fill up the majority of your first week. This is a step by step guide/checklist to getting everything in your arsenal set up, such as equipment, tools, security, and your Gitlab.com account. These todo’s provide you with the fundamentals.

[BDR Weekly Onboarding Schedule](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1yHZ0-oZAuq8keAZvFdeXSHdGC_bn3Fdr2VS2EO_Ug64/edit?usp=sharing) - This 3 week schedule will get you up to speed with the basics of BDRing.

### BDR & BDR Team Lead<a name="teamLead"></a>
#### Formal Weekly 1:1
- Mental check-in (winning and success)
- Discuss progress on targeted accounts
- Coaching - email strategy, campaigns, cadence, best practices
- Review goals at the account level and personal level
- Strategy for next week
- Upcoming events/campaigns that can be leveraged
- Personal goals and commitments


# BDR Workflow<a name="bdring"></a>
- Strategize to develop the proper qualifying questions for all types of customers.
- Be able to identify where a customer is in the sale and marketing funnel and take the appropriate action
- Generate Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)
- Inbound to work off of leads within SFDC
- Inbound does not touch any lead that has activity on it within the last 45 days by a different BDR.

## Lead/MQL Definition<a name="mql"></a>
A [Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1_kSxYGlIZNNyROLda7hieKsrbVtahd-RP6lU6y9gAIk/edit?usp=sharing) is a lead that reaches a certain point threshold (90 pts) based on a demographic information, engagement, and/or behavior. Each BDR will be placed into the Marketo Queue and will receive a high volume of MQLs to work. Criteria for those leads are set by Marketo and the Lead Generation team. We have two MQL buckets: (1) hand raisers and (2) passive leads.

### Hand Raisers (A Leads)<a name="aLeads"></a>
Hand raisers are leads who have filled out a sales contact us form or signed up for a free EE trial. These leads are automatic MQLs regardless of demographic information because they have exhibited clear interest in GitLab’s ability to fulfill a software need.

### Passive Leads<a name="passiveLeads"></a>
Passive leads are leads who have not filled out a contact us form or signed up for a free EE trial. For a passive lead to become an MQL, they must meet our minimum lead score of 90 pts. A passive lead becomes a MQL via a combination of demographic score and behavior/engagement score.

Because these leads can MQL without showing clear interest in GitLab paid products, they are routed to Business Development Representatives (BDRs) to qualify and assess sales-readiness.

## Lead Management<a name="leadManagement"></a>
What leads to qualify, how to do it, and who to send them to.

## Researching<a name="researching"></a>
### 3 X 3 X 3
Three things in three minutes about the:
- Organization
- Industry
- Prospect/Lead

### Salesforce
- Search Salesforce (SFDC) for the company name.
    - Are there other leads that are being worked?
    - Activity History
        - Who in the organization have we been in contact with? Can we follow up or reference this?
    - Is there an owned customer/prospect account?
    - Are there any open opportunities?

### LinkedIn
- Summary/bio
    - Does anything stand out that is relevant to their needs as an organization?
    - What is the lead’s role and how does that affect your messaging?
    - Have they published any articles that would be worth referencing?
- Previous work
    - Any Gitlab Customers that we can reference?
- Connections
    - Are they connected to anyone at GitLab for a possible introduction?

### Company Website
- Mission Statement
- Press Releases/Newsroom
- (ctrl F) search for keywords

## Prospecting<a name="prospecting"></a>

### Email Prospecting<a name="emailProspect"></a>
- Studies show that Executives read emails in the morning
- Expect to be forwarded to the right person (Always ask)
- Keep emails 90 words or less
- Break into readable stanzas
- Always be specific and tailored
- Make your emails viewable from a mobile device

#### Structuring a Prospecting Email
- Subject line
- Preview pain
- Opening stanza
    - Make it about them, not about you
- Benefit and value proposition
- Call to action (CTA)
    - Offer available times for a meeting/call
    - Create urgency

### Call Prospecting<a name="callProspect"></a>
- Call about them, not about you
- Be confident and passionate
- Aim for every role but focus on decision makers
- Ask for time
- Focus on your endgame (SQL)
- Make it easy to say yes
- Obtain a commitment

### Structuring a Prospecting Call
- Introduction
    - Immediately introduce yourself and GitLab
    - Ask for time
- Initial benefit statement
- Qualification
- Inform them/answer questions about GitLab
- Commitments

### Warm Discovery Calls
Purpose: To qualify leads faster and more accurately (SQL Qualification Criteria) than in an email exchange.

Process: In your reply message to setup/initiate a call, ask a few of your normal BDR questions to prep for the call. To save a step in emails include your Calendly link so leads may schedule the call directly.

    “Hi (lead name), this is (BDR) from GitLab. How are you today?”

    “Great, is now still a good time to talk about (primary issue)?”

After you’ve established the conversation is good to move forward, ask questions and guide the conversation in a way that enables the lead to tell you what their issue/problem is while also providing answers to the SQL QC. Your primary role is to gather information, and decide more appropriately how to provide assistance and/or qualify the lead for a call with an AE.

    “Great (lead name), thank you for sharing that information. I have a better feel now for how to move forward with your request/issue. I’m going to follow-up with an email recapping what we discussed, send over that documentation I promised and get you in touch with (account executive)”

## Qualifying<a name="qualifying"></a>
Your goal is to generate Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) by gathering all pertinent information needed for an Account Executive to take action. Some examples of sales qualification questions can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales-qualification-questions/). 	

### SQL Qualification Criteria<a name="sql"></a>

#### Current Defined Need
- Does the prospect have an identified need for GitLab?
- What is the prospect currently doing to address their need? What other technologies are they using?
- What version of EE are they interested in?
- [EE Product Qualification Questions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/EE-Product-Qualification-Questions/)

#### Budget
- Is there a budget secured for the project?
- Does the prospect have a realistic chance of securing the budget for GitLab?

#### Buying Process
- Who is the decision maker for GitLab?
- What is the buying process for procuring GitLab?
- What role does the prospect play in the current evaluation?

#### Timeline
- What is the timeline to make a decision?
- Are you currently in an existing contract that needs to expire before you can move forward? If yes, when does the contract expire?

#### Product Fit
- Are they interested in GitLab EE? Is GitLab EE a good fit for their need? (Needs to be YES)
- Do they currently use another version of GitLab?
- Are they familiar with our product family?

#### Scope
- How many seats are they interested in purchasing?
- What version of EE are they interested in?

#### Next Steps
- Is there a meeting set with an AE to discuss next steps?
- Did they request a quote?
- Are there specific questions/issues the AE should address?

### When to Create an Opportunity<a name="opportunity"></a>
When you have successfully qualified a lead, you will need to create an opportunity and handoff the lead to the assigned Account Executive (AE)/Account Owner.

Before a lead is converted or an opportunity is created the following must occur:
- Identified problem GitLab can solve - happens during introductory call
- Interest by prospect to learn more about GitLab - moving to discovery stage
- Discovery call scheduled with prospect - moving to discovery stage
- Interest by GitLab salesperson to pursue the opportunity

#### How to Convert a Lead Into an Opportunity
[This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q7DIE1tM7IOuCyQXLPFjOBAS52AL7QadpLb7pshw48/edit) document provides a step by step process on how to convert a lead to an opportunity. It includes the following information:
- [Opportunity Naming Conventions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/#opportunity-naming-convention)
- Required fields necessary for an opportunity be saved correctly

#### Handoff Process
Schedule a Discovery Call with the Account Owner/AE
- Schedule the call via Google Calendar, send invites
- Include yourself, the AE, and the prospect on the invite, it is required you join the call
- Name the event: Gitlab Discovery Call - {{Account Name}}
- Insert the AE’s [Zoom meeting link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GFpXMjOS-kBsqNV5aFdMho0c4NfU2311MkX-4cogVfQ/edit) into the ‘Where’ section of the Google Calendar invite.

## Variable Compensation Guidelines<a name="compensation"></a>
Full-time BDRs have a significant portion of their pay based on performance and objective attainment. Performance based "bonuses" are based quota attainment.

Actions for obtaining results will be prescribed and measured, but are intentionally left out of bonus attainment calculations to encourage experimentation. BDRs will naturally be drawn to activities that have the highest yield, but freedom to choose their own daily activities will allow new, higher yield activities to be discovered.

### Guidelines for Bonuses
- Team and individual quotas are based on GitLab's revenue targets
- Quotas will be made known by having each BDR sign a participant form that clearly lays out quarterly quotas that match the company's revenue plan
- Bonuses are paid quarterly.
- Bonuses are based solely on Sales Qualified Pipeline generated.
- A new BDR's first month's bonus is typically based on completing onboarding
