## Triage Process
### Engaging with Solutions Architects
For engaging Solutions, Architects, see [this page on the Solutions Architects handbook]()

### The SA Service Desk
The SA team works from the [SA Service Desk].  This is the central place for the Sales Team to interact with the SA team and request assistance for customers.  Discovery Calls, POCs, Professional Service Engagements all start as an issue on the SA Service Desk.

To open an issue, visit the [new SA Service Desk issue]() and select the `SA Activity` template.  This template collects the basic information about the need for SA engagement.  

#### Information to Collect
To help the Solutions Architect team ensure success for your customer, we request the following information *prior* to SA engagement:

* **Customer Information**: Customer name, opportunity size, Sales Force link
* **Preferred Date Options**: When would the customer want to have the call (including time zone information).
* **Opportunity Details**: What is the size of the opportunity?  What is the timeframe for purchase? 
* **Outcome**: What's in it for them?  
* **Challenges**: What roadblocks are they facing?  
* **Infrastructure**: What tools does the customer currently use?
* **SA Tasks**: What do you need from the SA's (demo/technical shotgun/services evaluation/etc.)

#### Labels
* **SA Backlog**: New issues coming into the SA 
* **SA Triaged**: This label will change names to show which SA is triaging this week.  Once the activity has been vetted by the SA team, approved, and SA Ownership is assigned, it is moved to this label
* **SA Doing**: Once an SA signals they are actively working the Issue, the issue is moved to SA Doing.  The issue will stay in this status until the SA and AE agree the Issue has been completed 
* **SA Action Items**: These are long-running strategic issue that the SA group is owning
* **SA Waiting**: This label indicates that the SA team is waiting on the AE for more information before advancing this issue.

* **EXPEDITE**: This label is only to be used if there is <24 hours until the requested event
* **Current Quarter Label**: 
* **Services**: If this opportunity involves or requires services, use this label to indicate that.
