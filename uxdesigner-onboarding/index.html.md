Awesome! You're about to become a GitLab UX Designer!
Make sure you've checked out our [handbook](/handbook) beforehand, so you get a feeling
of how we work at GitLab. Below you'll find everything you need to start designing.
If something is missing, add it (as goes with everything at GitLab)!

## GitLab instances

We have two main GitLab instances, as explained in the
[general onboarding](/handbook/general-onboarding#gitlabcom-vs-devgitlaborg).

## Getting started with designing for GitLab

To start, please read and follow the [UX Handbook](/handbook/ux), and the
[Design project README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/README.md)
and its [contribution guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Design tools

Every UX designer gets a license to [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/)
and [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). Other tools as needed can include,
but are not limited to: [Framer](https://framer.com/), [Origami by Facebook](http://origami.design/),
[Principle for Mac](http://principleformac.com/), and HTML/CSS/JS prototyping.
Previously we used [Antetype](http://www.antetype.com/) and have [switched](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19790)
to Sketch. Old Antetype design files are still be valuable. If necessary, see
[Converting antetype files for use with sketch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19864)

When in need of different tools, request those by filing an issue on our
[organization issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/organization/issues).
