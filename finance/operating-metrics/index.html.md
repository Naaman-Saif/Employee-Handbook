Purpose:  We review all key operating metrics that either i) appear in the Corporate metrics sheet or ii) are included in the our Operating Model. The goal for the monthly meeting is to understand month to month variances as well as variances against the plan, forecast and operating model.

Agenda:
1. Review metric and conclude on implications for operating model.
1. Discuss proposals for different measurement.
1. Determine if external benchmarks are required.
1. Discuss proposals for addition of new metrics.
1. Discuss proposals for deprecation of existing metrics

Timing:  Meetings are monthly starting on the 10th day after month end.

Invitees:  Mandatory attendees are the owner of the metric and eteam functional representative and the CFO.  Optional attendees are the rest of the e-team and anyone who has an interest in the metric.

Process:  The owner of the metric(s) drives the meeting and is responsible for updating the doc with necessary data, links, MRs, etc. Calendar invites should be editable by invitees.  Use the CFO Zoom number.
