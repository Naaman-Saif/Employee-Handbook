# Local Development Environment

- We use Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE. If you're using anything else, we HIGHLY recommend you to use Visual Studio Code. 
- IMPORTANT: Learning about debuging in VS Code is important. It'll save you days of your life (trust us!). [Please check this short 8 min video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oFKNL7vYV8)
- Use Robo Mongo for Local MongoDB Data Viewing and Editing. Download it from here [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download). Important: Do not download Studio 3T but Robo 3T. 
- Use Chrome as primary browser. It amkes devs lives simpler.
