- We use Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE. If you're using anything else, we HIGHLY recommend you to use Visual Studio Code. 
- IMPORTANT: Learning about debuging in VS Code is important. It'll save you days of your life (trust us!). [Please check this short 8 min video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oFKNL7vYV8)
