# Onboarding for Engineers

- Sign up on GitHub, Bitbucket (if you don't have an account already) and send your username to your manager and he'll add you to the organisation.
- Join #engineering channel on Slack.
- We don't usually assign email accounts to Junior Engineers, If you're a Sr Engineer - request one by emailing legal@hackerbay.io
